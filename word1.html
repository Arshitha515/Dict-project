    <h2>Meaning:</h2>
    <p>To have a strong desire or ambition to achieve something, typically something high or great.</p>


    <p><h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>
"Aspire" is used when someone has a strong ambition or desire to achieve something important or meaningful. 
It is commonly used in motivational or personal goal-related situations. For example, a student may aspire to become a doctor, 
which means they are working hard with a dream of achieving that profession. You could also say, “He aspires to be a great leader,” 
or “She aspires to win the competition.” The word often reflects positive energy, long-term commitment, and determination. 
We usually use it with “to” – such as “aspire to become” or “aspire to achieve.”
