    <h2>Meaning:</h2>
    <p>Feeling a quiet longing or gentle sadness, often due to remembering something from the past.</p>


    <p><h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>
"Wistful" is used to describe a feeling that is a mix of sadness and longing, often related to the past. 
You might say, “He gave a wistful smile as he looked at the old school building,” showing that he misses those days. 
The word is often used in emotional scenes in stories, movies, or poetry. It expresses a gentle kind of sadness, not heavy sorrow. 
It can describe facial expressions, thoughts, or moods. Wistful moments happen when someone remembers something beautiful 
that is gone or out of reach, like childhood memories, old friends, or dreams that didn’t come true.
